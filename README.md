### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Here's a list of my repos categorized by subject. Most of them were created to learn or teach something. I like to learn by building projects (from books, courses and tutorials) and by doing programming exercises (from books, Leetcode, HackerRank, Exercism, Koans etc.). Most of the projects are deployed on Heroku, if you want to check them out.
